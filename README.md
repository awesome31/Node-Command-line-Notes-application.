# Notes application using Command Line.

## Introduction

Created a simple repository that actually helps a user add notes using command line arguments. Created using NodeJS.

## Things that I learnt

- Module system in Node JS.
- Using external libraries, self created libraries and global modules with node.
- Using Command line arguments to create a full fledged application.
- File system manipulation.

## Details and Screenshot

All the notes are added to the notes.json file that we create. Validations are done as a part of creation.
